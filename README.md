## Game Rolling Die
Objective: The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game. However, there are risks with each roll. Be strategic!

### How to Play:
#### Players:

The game is for 2 players.
Each player takes turns rolling the die and trying to accumulate a total score of 100 or more to win.

#### Rolling the Die:
On your turn, you roll a standard 6-sided die.
After each roll, you accumulate points based on the die's value.

#### Special Rules:
Rolling a 1 or 6: If you roll a 1 or 6, your current turn score will be reset to 0. Your turn ends immediately, and you lose any points you earned during that turn.
Rolling anything else (2-5): You can keep rolling to accumulate points during your turn.

#### Passing the Turn:
At any point during your turn, you can choose to "Pass" instead of rolling the die again.
By passing, you save your current turn score, which is added to your overall total score.
Your turn then ends, and the next player rolls.

#### Winning the Game:
The first player to reach or exceed 100 points on their overall total score wins the game.
